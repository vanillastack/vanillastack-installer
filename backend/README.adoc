= VanillaStack Backend API

== Requirements

Docker or Node.js installed

Got to VanillaStack/backend and execute docker build and run command

[source,shell script]
----
mkdir VanillaStack
cd VanillaStack
git clone vs .
docker build -f docker/prod/Dockerfile \
  -t vanillastack-installer . && \
  docker run \
  --name vanillastack-installer -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  vanillastack-installer
----

or

[source,shell script]
----
cd VanillaStack/backend
npm install
npm run dev
----

== API

The API definition can be found with the backend running on:

[source,]
----
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/api-docs
----

The definition is written in OpenAPI and can be tested on the spot.

== WebSockets

WebSockets are using JSON-Objects for communication between front- and backend.

The JSON-Objects consists of a transactionId, an event, and the payload.
The *transactionId* is a generated number, which is used to identify a single process.
The *event* describes what kind of transaction it is.
Following events are possible: *INIT*, *EXEC* and *DONE*, which are describing specific scenario for JSON-Object states.
Each state expects a specific payload.

WebSocket are initialized through a connection upgrade request with the uuid as parameter of the requesting client.

[source,]
----
ws://localhost:3000?uuid=00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000000
----

The UUID can be requested by calling the /info endpoint.

After connecting the WS-Tunnel is open and will be used to transfer unbuffered async information from the backend.
For Example: The backend will send JSON-Objects with the event EXECUTION set, a transactionId which will be returned upon creating a request for the async execution and the unbuffered response as payload.

*Example EXEC-Object:*

[source,json]
----
{
    "transactionId": "0000000000",
    "event": "EXEC",
    "payload": "string"
}
----

The unbuffered execution will continue even when the WebSocket connection is terminated or closed.
With the uuid used to issue the unbuffered execution, the output stream through the WebSocket can be continued at anytime.
