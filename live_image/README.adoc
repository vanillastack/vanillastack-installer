= live_image

This is the directory, responsible for building the live-image for the installer.

The live image is an ISO image that can be booted directly via CDROM, USB or any other way you please.


== Technology

* Debian as a base Image
* live-build as build-chain
* Installer itself will be running as docker container
* Visual Frontend via Running Desktop-Environment with a Webbrowser
* the container image for the installer will be pulled at build-time and be squashed into the live image.
* this means that after boot of the live-image it will take some time, until the image is prepared and the container is running.
* therefore a chromium browser is started in App-mode with an splash-screen website, that is polling the installer for readiness, before redirecting there.


== Building

For Development there are two modes how to build:

* via gitlab-ci
* locally via docker

The scripts are split in a way, that they function as well locally as also in a gitlab-ci pipeline

For local building, we use docker to get the a defined debian:buster installation as base. In gitlab-ci we are already running in a debian:buster container, so steps differ a bit.

=== local building with docker

The Dockerfile mainly just consists of preparing a build-environment for live-build:
- copying the rootfs/ directory into the container-root
- calling `prepare-installer.bash`

Build the container:

  docker build -t vanilla-installer .

After you build that simple container you can run it with:

  `docker run -ti --name vanilla -v <OUTPUTPATH>/data:rw --privileged vanilla-installer`

In the container, the script `./build-installer.bash` is automatically started. At the end, the build-artifacts will be copied to `/data` where you should have mounted your output-directory to.

The privileged mode is currently neccessary for the builder to work, but we're trying to work around that.

=== building via gitlab-ci-pipeline

Because, we are already running in a fitting docker container, there is no need to rebuild. We just need to adjust the living room.

So its just a matter of copying the files around and calling `prepare-installer.bash` directly followed by `build-installer.bash`

Artifacts will be stored in the defined `OUTPUT` directory
